# ISTP Type Profile

A person whose perceptions are both of sensory origins and unconscious origins, but more on the sensory side than the unconscious side. 
I.e., the non-voluntary content of their consciousness is more coming from the senses than from intuitions, although both are present strongly.

While the perceptions of sensory origins are taken as is, one at a time, the content coming from the unconscious 
in the form of intuitions or felt-senses is compared to previous content and a framework of such content is developed.

Meanwhile, the person is busy thinking about the framework, rather than the immediate experience. 
This thinking is technical; no personal attachment to the framework is assumed or intended.

Finally, this person is troubled when having to give a personal evaluation of their sensory experience. 
For example, they would rather not be bothered with how others feel toward a specific object.
