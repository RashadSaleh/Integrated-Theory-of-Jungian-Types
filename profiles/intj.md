# INTJ Type Profile

A person who is busy experiencing perceptions from unconscious origins, such as intuitions or felt-senses. Yet, the experience is not taken as is, but compared to previous experience and integrated into a framework. This forms a context or structure for the individual.

Meanwhile, this person analyzes such perceptions, for example in terms of quality or quantity technically, not putting any personal value to their particular nature.

However, the framework itself is taken personally. For example, that a particular experience repeated this many times, at these certain places, with different strengths, etc. This forms a sense of identity for the individual.

Finally, such a person is prone to neglecting sensory experiences that do not relate to the framework or associated life plans.
