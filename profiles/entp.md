# ENTP Type Profile

A person whose content of consciousness is predominantly 
coming from the unconscious, in the form of intuitions, imagary, felt-senses, and the like -- as opposed to being from sensory origin. 
That is, the current sensory experience is given much less attention than the content coming from the unconscious. And, this 
content is experienced as is without much relation or comparison with past experience -- no framework is being developed of such experiences. 
The experience is flowing and in-the-moment.

On the other hand, the person has trouble forming a framework of past *sensory* experience. However, they spend much of their time reflecting on
this framework in non-personal ways, rather than exactly adding to the framework.

This person does give a personal evaluation of certain intuitions over others.
