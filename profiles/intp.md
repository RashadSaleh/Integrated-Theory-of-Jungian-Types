# INTP Type Profile

A person who experiences both perceptions from unconscious and sensory origins, 
but more on the unconscious side than the sensory side. That is, this person is more likely
to engage psychologically with content like intuitions, felt-senses, imagery, etc, than with the
immediate sensory surroundings. 

The person is experiencing such perceptions from unconscious origins as-is, without relation or
comparison with past experiences of similar nature. There is no framework of such perceptions that
is being developed. However, the sensory material is being compared and a framework of similar sensory
experience is developed, although it is not a strong one.

Meanwhile, the person is predominantly busy thinking in technical terms about the framework they developed,
where no sense of identity is being derived from the framework. There is less integration of sensory material
than further integration of what has already been integrated. Thus, this type lives almost entirely in their
own heads.

Finally, the person has trouble putting a personal value on certain intuitions over others.
