# ISTJ Type Profile

A person who is busy experiencing perceptions from sensory origins, such as textures or color patterns, etc. Yet, the experience is not taken as is, but compared to previous experience and integrated into a framework.

Meanwhile, this person analyzes such perceptions, for example in terms of quality or quantity technically, not putting any personal value to their particular nature.

However, the framework itself is taken personally. For example, that a particular experience repeated with such many objects, at these certain places, etc. This forms a sense of identity for the individual.

Finally, such a person has trouble with perceptual experiences from unconscious origins.
