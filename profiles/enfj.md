# ENFJ Type Profile

A person whose perceptions, or non-voluntary content of their consciousness,
are from both unconscious and sensory origins, although a little more on the unconscious side. 
I.e., they experience intuitions and felt-senses
more than they pay attention to the input coming from the senses.
However, both are present strongly.

While their sense experience is taken as is, the content coming from the unconscious is compared to previous
experience, and a framework of such experiences is developed.

Meanwhile, the person is busy experiencing this content in terms of what it means for them and others.

Finally, the person is conflicted between generalizing the framework to the entirety of mankind, and keeping
it related to the people, causes, etc, closest to them.
