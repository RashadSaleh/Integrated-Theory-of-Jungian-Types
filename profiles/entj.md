# ENTJ Type Profile

A person whose perceptions, or non-voluntary content of their consciousness,
are from both unconscious and sensory origins, although a little more on the unconscious side. 
I.e., they experience intuitions and felt-senses
more than they pay attention to the input coming from the senses.
However, both are present strongly.

While their sense experience is taken as is, the content coming from the unconscious is compared to previous
experience, and a framework of such experiences is developed.

Meanwhile, the person is busy experiencing this content in non-personal terms.

Finally, the person has trouble putting a personal value on the framework developed, being conflicted between
wanting to stay objective, while realizing that their framework is at least somewhat personal.
